## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Install ML Dependencies

**Note**: The ML libraries require some native dependencies. If you encounter build errors:

**Option A**: Install build tools (recommended for full ML features)
```bash
# Install Windows Build Tools
npm install --global windows-build-tools

# Then install ML packages
cd backend
npm install
```

**Option B**: Use the system without ML (it will work with rule-based algorithms)
The system gracefully falls back to rule-based algorithms if ML models aren't trained.

### Step 2: Train Models (as Admin)
```bash
# Via API
POST http://localhost:5000/api/ml/train
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>

# Or via CLI
cd backend
npm run train
```

### Step 3: Use AI Features
Once trained, all AI features are automatically available through the API!
