## 🔬 Algorithms

### Collaborative Filtering
Finds students with similar profiles and recommends courses they selected.

**Similarity Calculation**:
```
similarity = (1 - |GPA_diff| / 4.0) * 0.5 + department_match * 0.5
```

### Genetic Algorithm Optimization
Evolves allocation solutions over multiple generations.

**Process**:
1. Initialize random population
2. Evaluate fitness (preference satisfaction + GPA fairness)
3. Select top performers
4. Crossover and mutation
5. Repeat for N generations

**Fitness Function**:
```
fitness = Σ(preference_score * 0.7 + gpa_score * 0.3) / total_allocations
```

### Neural Network Training
Uses backpropagation with sigmoid activation.

**Training Parameters**:
- Iterations: 1500-2000
